CocoaBuilder
============

CocoaBuilder is a .net application thats allows you to edit/create files produced by Interface Builder on MacOS.
It has been created using c# trying to emulate objc syntax because when I start I didn't know the existence of some
opensource implementation like gnustep or cocotron and I was very fond of c#.
Some Cocoa classes have been reverse engineered and others come from gnustep
