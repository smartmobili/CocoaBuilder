CocoaBuilder
============

CocoaBuilder is a .net application thats allows you to edit/create files produced by Interface Builder on MacOS.
It has been created using c# trying to emulate objc syntax because at this time I didn't know the existence of some
opensource implementation like gnustep or cocotron.
Majority of Cocoa classes have been reverse engineered...
